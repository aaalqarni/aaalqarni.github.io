Investigation of the performance of Arabic text classification when Part of Speech (POS) tagging information is used to extract features suggests that the words achieved the best classification performance when the number of features was low; however, the classification performance can be marginally increased when nouns, verbs, and adjectives are used as features, given that the number of features is increased.
