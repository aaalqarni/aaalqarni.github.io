A few studies have been conducted to sentimentally analyse YouTube comments, especially Kids’ YouTube videos. In this chapter, we proposed a sentiment analysis model evaluation based on seven machine learning classifiers to select the most effective classifiers for analysing YouTube’s comments. We also examined the performance of each classifier using different features. The proposed sentiment analysis model achieved a higher accuracy of 96% when using the support vector machine with the N-gram features.
